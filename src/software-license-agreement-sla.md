# Software License Agreement (SLA)

#### 1.Definitions

1.1. APEX means Apex Turbine Testing Technologies, Inc., a company incorporated under the laws of the state of Tennessee in the United States of America.

1.2. CUSTOMER means the person or organization purchasing or using APEX Software and Licensed

Materials.

1.3. Maintenance Agreement is a written agreement between APEX and CUSTOMER whereby APEX provides technical support to CUSTOMER and correction of software defects identified by CUSTOMER under agreed-upon terms and conditions.

1.4. Software and Licensed Materials means any materials that APEX provides to CUSTOMER including but not limited to software, training materials, technical descriptions of the Software, and other reference materials.

#### 2. Software License, Payment, and Installation

2.1. APEX grants to CUSTOMER a nonexclusive, perpetual, nontransferable license to use the Software and the Licensed Materials in accordance with the mechanism described in section 2.4. Such grant extends to use Enhancements as APEX produces them and provides them to CUSTOMER under terms of an existing Maintenance Agreement between the parties.

2.2. APEX may deliver the Software and Licensed Materials to CUSTOMER using a variety of means and completely at the discretion of APEX. Methods of delivery of the Software and Licensed Materials may include installation executables, zip files or other means provided through distributable media (such as DVD’s, Removable USB devices, etc.) or by download over APEX provided internet web portals. Customer may install the Software and Licensed Materials on any appropriate computational platform that adheres to APEX’s published performance minimums.

2.3. CUSTOMER shall pay APEX the cost of the Software and Licensed Materials at an agreed-upon price and in accordance with agreed-upon payment terms. If payments terms are unspecified, CUSTOMER payments are to be NET 30. Unless otherwise specified in writing and agreed to by both parties, all payments are to be in U.S. Dollars. Likewise, CUSTOMER is responsible for any additional duties, taxes, import fees, currency exchange fees of other fees as they may arise in association with the transaction. All such costs will be paid by CUSTOMER.

2.4. Upon full payment for the Software and Licensed Materials, APEX shall provide CUSTOMER Software License Keys of the form and number specified by the purchase, which enable the Software and Licensed Materials to operate on an appropriate computational platform. APEX may, in its sole discretion, provide CUSTOMER with Temporary License keys as described in 2.4.1 for purposes of performing acceptance testing or until payment in full is received. Types of license keys include:

2.4.1.NODE-LOCKED licenses which enable the Software and Licensed Materials to function on a single CUSTOMER identified computation platform as identified in section 2.2. Such license may be Perpetual, that is, non-expiring, or Temporary with a pre-established expiration date. NODE- LOCKED licenses may be moved from one computational platform to another under the terms of an existing Maintenance Agreement between the parties, by requesting new license keys from APEX. In the event that no Maintenance Agreement exists between the parties, APEX may, in its sole discretion, provide new keys and charge CUSTOMER a fee for this service.

2.4.2.FLOATING licenses which can be accessed over a network to an APEX-configured LICENSE SERVER. FLOATING licenses may be used on any computation platform upon which the Software and Licensed Materials have been installed as described in section 2.1 and which have network access to the LICENSE SERVER. FLOATING licenses installed on a LICENSE SERVER shall be managed using an appropriate software license manager of APEX choosing.

2.4.3.Such LICENSE SERVER described in 2.2.2 may support so-called license BORROWING, that is, use of a license from a LICENSE SERVER. Such BORROWED licenses will automatically be configured as expiring licenses with the expiration date of the license controlled via the license manager. Upon reaching the expiration date of the license, the license will be automatically re- included on the LICENSE SERVER. CUSTOMER may also return licenses to the LICENSE SERVER manually by reconnecting the computational platform upon which the BORROWED license was loaded to the LICENSE SERVER network.

2.5. All licenses granted hereunder are for the internal business use of CUSTOMER and Affiliates only. CUSTOMER may extend the use of the Software to leased employees or outsourced labor as long as the leased employees or outsourced labor use the software only for CUSTOMER’s benefit.

2.6. This license does not permit CUSTOMER to: (i) Use the Software for a service bureau application for the benefit of third parties (other than Affiliates who are licensed hereunder, to the extent of such licensing); or (ii) sublicense, or rent the Software; or (iii) use the Software for any purpose other than CUSTOMER’s internal business use.
